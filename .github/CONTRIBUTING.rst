Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at https://github.com/apehex/gdpyr/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GDPyR apehex could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official gdpyr apehex docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/apehex/gdpyr/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `gdpyr` for local development.

1. Fork the `gdpyr` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/gdpyr.git
3. Assuming you have poetry installed, you can **create a new environment with all the dependencies** by typing::

    $ make init
    $ poetry shell

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ make lint
    $ make test
    Or
    $ make test-all

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7, and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/apehex/gdpyr/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Add a New Test
--------------

When fixing a bug or adding features, it's good practice to add a test to demonstrate your fix or new feature behaves as expected. These tests should focus on one tiny bit of functionality and prove changes are correct.

To write and run your new test, follow these steps:

1. Add the new test to `tests/`. Focus your test on the specific bug or a small part of the new feature.

2. If you have already made changes to the code, stash your changes and confirm all your changes were stashed::

    $ git stash
    $ git stash list

3. Run your test and confirm that your test fails. If your test does not fail,rewrite the test until it fails on the original code::

    $ make test

4. (Optional) Run the tests with tox to ensure that the code changes work with different Python versions::

    $ make test-all

5. Proceed work on your bug fix or new feature or restore your changes. To restore your stashed changes and confirm their restoration::

    $ git stash pop
    $ git stash list

6. Rerun your test and confirm that your test passes. If it passes, congratulations!

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

$ pytest tests.test_gdpyr


Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
